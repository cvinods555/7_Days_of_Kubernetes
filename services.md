### Kubernetes Service and Its Types:

    In Kubernetes, a **Service** is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Services allow you to expose your application to other pods within the cluster or to external clients.

    ### Types of Kubernetes Services:

    1. **ClusterIP (default)**:
    - Exposes the service on an internal IP within the cluster.
    - **Scope**: Accessible only within the cluster.
    - **Use Case**: Best for internal communication between services and pods within the cluster.
    - **Configuration**: Automatically assigned by Kubernetes, no need to configure ports.

    2. **NodePort**:
    - Exposes the service on a static port on each node’s IP address.
    - **Scope**: Accessible both inside the cluster and externally via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
    - **Use Case**: Best for exposing services to external clients without the need for a load balancer.
    - **Configuration**: Requires you to specify or accept a node port, which is used for external access.

    3. **LoadBalancer**:
    - Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
    - Automatically creates a load balancer to distribute traffic to your service.
    - Common in cloud environments.

    4. **ExternalName**:
    - The ExternalName service is not used for internal communication between pods within the cluster. Instead, it allows your pods to communicate with a service that is outside the Kubernetes cluster by using a DNS name (URL) of the external service.
    - No proxying of traffic; instead, it returns a CNAME record for external services.
